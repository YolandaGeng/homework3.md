finance story 

According to the data from Federal Election Commission, U.S. Representative Charlie Crist raised a total of $1,272,415.17 from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017. 

His total contributions are $1,272,089.18, which include $960,830.01 of individual contributions, $305,859.17 of other committee contributions and $5,400.00 candidate contributions. 

His total disbursements are $248,976.59. It seems that he spent most of his money on travel, business system services, payroll taxes, consulting, processing fees, credit card merchant acct fees……

Consulting is a huge part of his disbursements. For example, he spent $8,875.04 on fundraising consulting, $3,250.00 on a campaign consultant, 2,327.66 on technical consulting, and $7,500.00 on compliance consulting. It shows that he pays so much attention on this part. 

Also, another interesting thing that I found is about the money he spent on his travel.  

He chose some cheap airlines such as Southwest and JetBlue for several of his trips. It shows that although he is famous, he still tries to live modestly as ordinary people do and tries to use money wisely, which may help him earn more support and money from his supporters.
